Lesson 3: The Brave Pawn Parade 
Board (excitedly): “Welcome back, little explorers! Today, we’re heading to the most hardworking place in all of Chess Land — Pawn Village!” 
Chintu: “Ooooh! Look at them! They’re marching like tiny toy soldiers!”
Minku: “Aww, they’re so cute! Why are they all standing in one straight line?”
Board: “Because Pawns always start their adventure from the front line — they’re the protectors of the kingdom!”
(Tiny drums roll as sixteen Pawns appear in two rows — eight white, eight black. Their helmets shine and little boots stomp the ground.)
Pawn Leader (saluting smartly): “Attention, explorers! I’m Captain Pawn! Leader of the Pawn Parade!”
Chintu (giggling): “Captain Pawn? That sounds like my school’s PE teacher — always shouting ‘stand straight!’”
Pawn Leader (laughing): “Ha ha! Well, I do make sure my team walks perfectly straight — one step forward at a time! That’s how we Pawns move — steady and brave!”
Minku: “But you can only move one step? That’s so slow!”
Pawn Leader: “Ah, but slow and steady wins the race! We never look back — always move forward, because soldiers never retreat!”
Board: “That’s right! And when a Pawn starts the game, he can take a big first step — two squares forward if he wants!”
Chintu: “Whoa! Like a rocket boost at the start!”
Pawn Leader (grinning): “Exactly! And when we fight enemies, we don’t attack straight — we strike slant!”
(Demonstrates with tiny sword swings diagonally)
Minku: “So you move straight but fight slant? That’s funny!”
Pawn Leader: “Hehe, that’s our secret style! March straight, attack slant — like ninjas!”
Board (smiling): “But that’s not all, my little friends. Do you know what happens if a Pawn marches all the way to the other end of the board?”
Chintu (eyes wide): “He gets a chocolate?”
Board (laughing): “Even better! He becomes a hero — a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight! That’s called promotion!”
Minku (excited): “Whaaat! So a small Pawn can become a big hero?”
Pawn Leader (proudly): “Yes! We might start small, but we dream big. One brave step at a time — and one day, we reach the other side and become legends!”
Chintu (smiling): “That’s like when I started learning cycling — I fell a lot, but now I’m super fast!”
Board: “Exactly, Chintu! Every big hero was once a beginner — just like the Pawns!”
Pawn Leader (saluting): “Remember, explorers — always move forward, never give up, and protect your King with courage!”
 [All Pawns chant together, marching proudly]
 “Left! Right! Brave and bright!
We guard the King both day and night!”
Board (cheerfully): “And that’s the spirit of the Pawn Parade!”
