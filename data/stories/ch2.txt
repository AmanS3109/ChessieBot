Lesson 2: The King’s Great Lesson
(Soft sitar and drum music plays)
Board (excitedly): “Welcome back, my brave explorers! Guess what — His Majesty is wide awake today! We’re going to his castle in E1 ”
Chintu (teasing): “Hehe, really? Or did he just wake up from another nap?”
King (stretching with a yawn):“Ahh… My royal naps are very important, young one! Even kings need their beauty sleep!”
Minku (giggling): “So, K, last time you told us everyone protects you — but how do you move in the game? Do you run or fly?”
King (grinning):
 “Ah, my dear child… I don’t run, I think! I move slowly — just one step at a time.”
Board (explaining): “That’s right! The King can move one square in any direction — forward, backward, side, or even slant!”
Chintu (wide-eyed): “Only one step? That’s so slow!”
King (smiling kindly): “Ah, yes — but every step I take must be safe and smart. Because if I’m caught… the whole kingdom falls!”
Board (whispering): “Let me tell you a story — one every piece in Chess Land remembers…”
(Background changes to a dreamlike scene — a golden kingdom slowly fading into shadows.)
Narrator tone (Board): “Once upon a time, there was a kingdom called Chatura Rajya, ruled by a wise King named Raja Nipun. He loved his people dearly — but his people forgot something very important…”
Minku (curious): “What did they forget?”
Board (sadly): “They stopped protecting their King. The Queen was too busy showing off her power, the Knights raced around playing games, the Bishops kept arguing about directions, and the Pawns… well, they were too busy eating ladoos!”
Chintu (laughing): “Haha! Pawns eating ladoos!”
Board (seriously): “Yes, and one day, when everyone was distracted, an enemy kingdom sneaked in and captured their King. Without the King, their entire kingdom turned dark and silent.”
King (solemnly): “You see, my little explorers… a kingdom can have brave soldiers and powerful queens — but without their King, everything falls apart.”
(He places his hand over his heart — soft glow around him)
King: “Every move matters. Every piece matters. But the King — he holds the heart of the game.”
Board (cheerful again):
 “Alright! Time to practice what we learned! Let’s see if you can help the King move safely.”
(A glowing 8×8 board appears under their feet. The King stands in the middle — square e1.)
Minku (pointing): “So he starts here?”
Board: “Exactly! The King begins right in the middle of his home — square e1 for white, and e8 for black!”
King (proudly): “That’s my royal throne! From here, I can see my entire kingdom — the Pawns in front, the Queen by my side, the Rooks guarding the corners…”
Chintu: “Can we move you, King ji?”
King: “Of course! But only one step, remember. Try moving me forward — to e2!”
(They tap, and the King takes one slow, funny step forward — cartoonish sound “boop!”)
King (huffing): “Whew! That was a long journey! Time for a chai break!”
Chintu & Minku laugh.
Scene 4: Lesson of the Day
Board (wrapping up):
 “So, little explorers, what did we learn today?”
Minku:
 “The King moves and captures one step in any direction — but we must protect him!”
Chintu:
 “Because if he’s caught, the whole kingdom — and the game — ends!”
King (smiling proudly):
 “Exactly! You’re both royal geniuses! Remember, strength isn’t about how far you go — it’s about knowing when to move.”
Board (sparkling):
 “And that’s why the King’s step — slow and steady — keeps Chess Land safe and happy!”
King (yawning again):
 “Now… my royal duties are done. Time for another nap!”
Chintu:
 “Just like Papa after Sunday lunch!”
All laugh as the screen fades with a jingle:
“One step at a time, says the King so wise,
Protect him well, that’s your prize!
He moves just one, not two or three,
But without the King, there’s no victory!”
