Scene 1:  Discovery in Nani’s Attic


Setting: Dusty Indian attic with old junk and glowing trunk in a corner.
Chintu: “Aachoo! Minku! The attic looks very scary, it's very dark and smelly too. 
Minku: Loooooook what i found, a glowing  box!!!
Chintu: Maybe it has candies! It says sha—taaa-raa-j”
Minku: (giggles) “candies don’t glow, silly and besides it says shatraj, I think thats the game of chess!
Chintu: Chess? 
Chintu knocks on the trunk — it glows brighter. A soft “hummm” sound fills the air.
A tiny scroll floats out — it reads: ““Step through the letters, count each square —
Where black meets white, you’ll find the adventure there!””
Chintu: Is this like a spell which will take us to magical land like the stories nani told us?
Mink: Let's try it out! 
“Say the spell to enter the Land of Shatranj!”
Minku:
Both together: (clapping and chanting fast)
 ““Step through the letters, count each square —
Where black meets white, you’ll find the adventure there!”” 
Effect: The trunk bursts open with sparkles — wind swirls, glowing pieces fly — and both kids are sucked into a vortex of light!
Scene 2: Landing in Chessland


Visuals: They land thud! on a huge floating checkered ground. Around them — castles made of rooks, gleaming rivers and ground shaped like chess paths with dark and light squares
Chintu: (rubbing head) “Ouch! Where are we didi? This looks so magical and colorful!!! 
Minku: “Chintu! This ground looks like a chess board! And all the houses and people look familiar too!!!, are we in a chess land?????”
Voice: (deep, echoing, warm) “Indeed you are!”
A Board floats up, blinking squares like eyes.
Chintu: “Whoa! You talk?! Are you a talking carpet?”
Board: “Ha ha! Not a carpet, little one — I’m a chess board!” (yawns) it’s been so long since any kid opened the doors to this world. “Hello, young explorers! ”
Minku: “Wow! 8 rows and 8 columns — that makes it 64 squares!”


Scene 3:  Meet the residents
Board (excitedly): “Hellooo, little explorers! Welcome back to Chess Land! It’s a land of two great kingdoms — one sparkly white and one shiny black !”
 “Ta-da! Here comes… His Majesty!”


King (half-yawning, half-grumpy):“Yaaawn… Ahem, ahem… Who dares disturb my royal nap time?” 
Board (giggles): “Oh-ho! Wake up, Your Majesty! We’ve got new visitors — little humans ready to learn chess!”
King (stretching and fixing his crooked crown):“Oh! Hello, my royal guests! I’m the King of Chess Land! Everyone calls me K”
Chintu (whispering to Minku): “Hehe! He looks just like Papa when he wakes up from his afternoon nap!”
King (chuckling): “Ha-ha! That’s a good one, lil guy! You know, I move veryyyy slooowly, but I think carefully and keep everyone safe. But remember — in Chess Land, everything happens for the King!”(dramatically) “Every soldier, every piece — they fight for me, protect me, and keep me safe! Because if I’m caught… oh dear, the whole game ends!” ”
Minku (wide-eyed): “So everyone fights to keep you safe?”
Chintu: “So that means… you’re the most important, right?”
Board (nodding): “Exactly! Just like at home, when you and Chintu fight for the last piece of chocolate — that chocolate is your King!”
Chintu: “Ooooh! So chocolate is our King?!”
Minku (giggling): “Then I’m definitely the Queen — because I always win the chocolate battle!” 
King (laughing warmly): “Haha! See? You’ve understood perfectly! Everyone fights for something precious — in Chess Land, that’s me!”
Board (smiling): “Well said, Your Majesty! That’s why all our heroes — the Queen, Knights, Bishops, Rooks, and Pawns — train day and night to protect their King.” 
Queen (rushing in with a swirl of her gown):
 “Oh dear! King, are you showing off again?”  “Hello, my little sweethearts! I’m the Queen of Chess Land — everyone calls me Q!  
Board (smiling):
 “Welcome, Your Majesty! You’re always so busy!” 
Queen (laughing):
 “Oh yes! I clean the castle, cook dinner, plan battles, and still find time to make everyone smile!” 
Minku (giggling):
 “You’re just like my Mummy! She also runs everywhere all day!”
Queen (smiling warmly):
“Exactly, beta! Queens — and moms — never rest, but we do it all with love!” We all protect what we love — I protect the King, the King protects the land, and love protects us all!”  💫
Board:
“Alright, Your Majesty, we’ll let you get back to your royal chores! The kids are off to explore more of Chess Land!”
Queen (waving):
“Bye-bye, my little stars! Be kind and brave!” 
Board (grinning):
“Hold on tight, kiddos — here comes the strongest guard of Chess Land!” 
Rook (marching in proudly):
“Attention, everyone! I’m Rook — the castle’s tall, mighty tower! You can call me R! ”
Chintu (eyes wide):
“Whoa! You look so strong! What do you do, Mr. R?”
Rook (smiling):
I protect the King and Queen from my tall towers! No one dares come close while I’m on guard!” 
Minku (laughing):
“You’re like our grandpa — always watching everyone!”
Rook (laughs):
“Exactly! I stand tall, stay loyal, and never leave my post. That’s what a true guard does!” 
Board:
“Our Rook teaches us — strength isn’t just about muscles, it’s about standing firm and protecting who you love.” 
Board (smiling): “Look who’s coming — The most cool resident of Chess Land!” 
Bishop (with a friendly laugh): “Hey there, little buddies! I’m Bishop — everyone calls me B!”
Chintu (excited): “ What do you do here?”
Bishop (grinning): “Well, I like doing things my own way! I never walk straight — I go slant-slant like this!” (makes zig-zag gesture with hands) “Because straight roads are sooo boring rightttt!” 
Minku (giggling): “Hehe! You’re just like my Chachu — always doing things in a fun, silly way!”
Bishop (laughing):“Exactly, beta! Life’s more fun when you’re a little different!” 
Knight (shouting): “Neighhh! Make way for me”(does a dramatic jump and lands next to Bishop) Hey B, how  are you, ahhhh i see we’ve got guests. 
Board: Hey Mr. N, This is chintu and she is minku our new friends.
Knight: Hey guys, I’m the knight known as ‘K’.  I’m the the best rider in Chess Land!”. As you saw I can jump over others and do whatever i want.
Mink (laughing): “You jump like Chintu when I steal my the TV remote!”
Knight (winks):
 “Haha! Exactly! I love jumping and doing things my own special way — always full of surprises!” 
Board (cheerfully):
 “Our Knight is brave and clever — never afraid to take a different path! Everyone in Chess Land jumps, runs, or fights  for the King, their treasure!”
K & B (together):
 “Bye-bye, little friends!” 
Chintu:
 “Chess Land is so colorful and fun!”
Minku:
 “Yeah! Everyone here has such a cool personality!” 
Board (happily): “Now we’re walking towards Pawn Village! Look — sixteen tiny Pawns live here! Eight work for the White Kingdom 🤍 and eight for the Black Kingdom . They’re all brothers and sisters!”
(They enter the village — tiny Pawns are practicing their little marches and sword swings. Tap-tap-tap! )
Pawn Leader (saluting smartly):“Hey there, little explorers! I’m the Pawn, and these are my brothers and sisters!” 
Minku (smiling): “Aww, you’re all so tiny! What can you do?”
Pawn Leader (standing tall): “I may be small, but I’m a soldier of Chess Land! I guard the King’s castle and protect my team!” 
Chintu (laughing): “Oh! You’re just like Bruno, our dog — he guards our home at night too! Nice to meet you, Mr. Pawn!” 
Board (smiling): “Exactly! Pawns may be tiny, but they’re brave and loyal — they march forward, protect the King, and never give up!”
Minku: “So everyone — Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawns — they all protect the King?”
Board: “Yes, because in Chess Land, the King is the heart. If the heart stops, the whole world stops. Just like your favorite toy or chocolate — you’d do anything to keep it safe, right?”
Chintu (grinning): “Then I’m definitely a Knight! I’ll jump over anyone for chocolate!” 

[Soft happy music — “Journey to the Chess Board!”]
Board (excitedly):
“Okay, my little explorers! Guess where we’re going next? To the most magical place in Chess Land!” 
Chintu (eyes big):
“Where are we going, Mr. Board?”
Board (smiling):
“To the Big Battle Field! This is where our friends — the King, Queen, Knights, Bishops, Rooks, and Pawns — all play together!” 
(They walk ahead — the ground begins to glow with black and white boxes.)
Minku (amazed):
“Wow! It’s so big! And look — all squares!” 
Board (proudly):
“Yes! This is the Chess Board! It has 8 rows and 8 columns — that means 64 little boxes!
Some are black, some are white — just like night and day!” Chintu (pointing):
“But what are those letters and numbers on the sides?”
Board (smiling kindly):
“Ahh, those are our magic names! The letters A to H go this way — A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H!
And the numbers 1 to 8 go up and down — 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8!”
Minku:
“So every square has a name?”
Board (clapping):
“Yes! Just like your house has an address!
See this corner? That’s A1! Next to it is B1, then C1 — all the way to H1!
Then comes the next row — A2, B2, and so on till A8!”
Chintu (smiling):
“So if the Queen lives on D1… that’s her home!” 
Board (laughing):
“Correct! Every hero has their own special square. These letters and numbers help us find them — like a treasure map!” 
Minku (grinning):
“That’s awesome! I want to learn all their squares!”
Board (cheerfully):
“You will, my brave explorers! Welcome to the Ultimate Chess Board — where every move starts, and every story begins!”
