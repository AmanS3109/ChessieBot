Magical light glows softly as Chessy floats into view.
Chessy smiles and says, “Hello dosto! Main hoon Chessy, aapka magical guide! Main har lesson, har game mein aapke saath rahunga! Ready ho? Chalo, Chessland ki magical duniya mein chalte hain!”
Chessy softly adds that Chessland is a world where every important character is remembered by a special letter.
The screen transitions gently.
The scene shifts into a dusty attic, where a glowing old trunk sits in the corner.
Chintu looks around and says that the place is very dark.
Minku points at the trunk and says it is shining.
The trunk shakes slightly, and a tiny “Tap the box!” icon appears.
Chintu tries reading the letters and says, “Kya likha hai… Cheese?”
Minku laughs and corrects him, saying it is “chess.
Chessy appears playfully and explains that chess is a game where letters help remember everything.
Chessy asks the child to tap the trunk.
 Chessy appears playfully and asks the child to tap the trunk.
The child taps, and the trunk slowly opens with a soft burst of confetti.
A warm magical light rises from inside, and a glowing scroll floats upward.
From the scroll, a tiny spark-creature appears, leaving a shimmering trail behind.
In a magical echo, it says, “Letters ko gino… squares ko gino… aur tab hogi kahaani shuru!”
Chintu and Minku respond happily, saying, “Letters ko follow karo!”
Chessy nods and says that following letters helps remember Chessland forever.
Wind swirls around them, and chess pieces float into the air.
Chessy laughs and says, “Hold tight! Chessland jaa rahe hain!”
A golden light surrounds them and pulls them into the magical world, and the screen fades out.
Sparkles slowly fade as Chintu and Minku land softly on a shiny magical ground. Chessy floats down from the sky with a big smile. Chessy welcomes the children and says, “Welcome dosto… Chessland mein aapka swagat hai! Main hoon Chessy, tumhara guide is magical journey mein!”
Chintu excitedly says that everything looks magical.
Minku says the ground looks like a giant chessboard.
Chessy laughs and explains, “Bilkul! Tum Chessland ke magical squares par khade ho!”

Chessy explains that chess pieces have names and letters.
Chintu asks what Chessy does here. Chessy laughs and explains, “Main poore Chessland ko dekhta hoon. Aur ab… chalo, main tumhe Chessland ke protectors se milata hoon!”
A golden light shines as the King enters, stretching and yawning.
The King slowly says, “Ahem, ahem… kaun hai jo meri royal naptime disturb kar raha hai?”
Chessy teases him, telling him that young guests have come to meet him.
The King stands up and says warmly, “Oh hello, mere royal guests! Main hoon Chessland ka King—sab mujhe K bulate hain!”
Chessy clearly explains that K ka matlab King hota hai. Chess me hum king ko K kehte hai.
Jab bhi koi poochta hai “K kya hai?”, answer hamesha King hota hai.
The King laughs and says,
“Haha, sahi kaha! Main dheere chalta hoon, par sabko safe rakhta hoon. Chessland mein sab milkar mujhe protect karte hain!”
Chintu whispers to Minku that the King K unke papa jese hai jab wo nap se uth te hai. 
The King laughs and says, “Haha, sahi kaha! Main dheere chalta hoon, par sabko safe rakhta hoon. Chessland mein sab milkar mujhe protect karte hain!”
Minku asks if everyone fights to keep him safe.
Chessy gently explains, “Bilkul! Jaise tum apna chocolate protect karti ho Chintu se… woh chocolate tumhara King hota hai!”
Chintu happily says, “Ooooh, chocolate King!” and everyone laughs.
 The King happily says, “Chessy, ab inhe Chessland ke baaki residents se milvao!”
Chessy smiles and says, “Chalo dosto, aage badhte hain. Bye-bye King K!”
A beautiful glow appears and the Queen enters with a warm smile.
She says, “Hello mere pyare stars! Main hoon Chessland ki Queen, sab mujhe Q kehte hai.”
Chessy explains that chess me Q ka matlab Queen hota hai, hum queen ko Q kehte hai — jo sabka khayal rakhti hai.
Minku says she looks just like her mother, who does everything at once.
The Queen laughs and says, “Haan beta, Queens aur mums kabhi rest nahi karte. Hum sabko safe rakhte hain — pyaar se.”
Chessy guides everyone forward.
The Rook marches in like a tall tower. He says, “Hey little explorers! Main hoon R — Chessland ka strong protector!”
Chessy explains that Chess me R ka matlab Rook hota hai, jo seedha aur strong hota hai.
Chintu says he looks as strong as his grandpa.
Rook proudly replies, “Haha, bilkul! Main hamesha King ko safe rakhta hoon!”
The Bishop slides in playfully.
He says, “Hiii buddies! Main hoon B — thoda fun, thoda silly!”
Chessy explains that chess me B ka matlab Bishop hota hai, jo slanted ya tircha chalta hai.
Minku giggles and says he’s just like her uncle.
The Bishop says he walks slanted and likes having fun.
A loud “Nayyyy!” echoes and the Knight jumps into the scene.
He says, “Make way! Main hoon N — jo hamesha jump karke aata hoon!”
Chessy explains that chess me N ka matlab Knight hota hai, aur Knight jump karta hai.
Chessy adds that N is used so Knight is not confused with King (K).
Chintu teases that he is just like Minku when she jumps excitedly.
Everyone laughs.
The group then reaches Pawn Village, where tiny footsteps can be heard.
The Pawn Leader appears and says, “Hello explorers! Hum chhote hain, par hum brave protectors hain!”
Chessy explains that P ka matlab Pawn hota hai — chhota, par important.
Minku calls them baby soldiers.
Chintu says they look like heroes who keep everyone safe.
The Pawn Leader proudly says, “Exactly! Hum King ko protect karte hain!”
Chessy asks the children to tap each Pawn when it pops up to say hello.
Each tap makes a cute “peep” sound, and after three taps, a small sparkle celebration appears.
Chessy tells the children that the Pawns are now their friends.
Chessy gathers everyone — the Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawns — and explains that they all work together to protect King K.
Chessy repeats clearly:

K = King

Q = Queen

R = Rook

B = Bishop

N = Knight

P = Pawn

Chessland is like a family.
Chintu laughs and says, “Toh main Knight hoon! Chocolate ke liye jump karunga!”
Everyone laughs together.
Chessy concludes happily, saying, “Shabash dosto! Agla adventure — ready? Chalo!”
