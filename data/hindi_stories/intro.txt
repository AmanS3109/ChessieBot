Magical light glows softly as Chessy floats into view.
Chessy smiles and says, “Hello dosto! Main hoon Chessy, aapka magical guide! Main har lesson, har game mein aapke saath rahunga! Ready ho? Chalo, Chessland ki magical duniya mein chalte hain!”
The screen transitions gently.
The scene shifts into a dusty attic, where a glowing old trunk sits in the corner.
Chintu looks around and says that the place is very dark.
Minku points at the trunk and says it is shining.
The trunk shakes slightly, and a tiny “Tap the box!” icon appears.
Chintu tries reading the letters and says, “Kya likha hai… Cheese?”
Minku laughs and corrects him, saying it is “chess. Chessy appears playfully and asks the child to tap the trunk.
The child taps, and the trunk slowly opens with a soft burst of confetti.
A warm magical light rises from inside, and a glowing scroll floats upward.
From the scroll, a tiny spark-creature appears, leaving a shimmering trail behind.
In a magical echo, it says, “Letters ko gino… squares ko gino… aur tab hogi kahaani shuru!”
Chintu and Minku respond happily, saying, “Letters ko follow karo!”
Wind swirls around them, and chess pieces float into the air.
Chessy laughs and says, “Hold tight! Chessland jaa rahe hain!”
A golden light surrounds them and pulls them into the magical world, and the screen fades out.
Sparkles slowly fade as Chintu and Minku land softly on a shiny magical ground. Chessy floats down from the sky with a big smile. Chessy welcomes the children and says, “Welcome dosto… Chessland mein aapka swagat hai! Main hoon Chessy, tumhara guide is magical journey mein!”
Chintu excitedly says that everything looks magical.
Minku says the ground looks like a giant chessboard.
Chessy laughs and explains, “Bilkul! Tum Chessland ke magical squares par khade ho!”
A square beneath them begins glowing. Chessy asks them to tap the glowing square to wake it up.
The child taps, the square lights up brightly, and confetti and candy appear.
Chessy proudly says, “Amazing job! Yeh ek light square hai!”
Chintu asks what Chessy does here. Chessy laughs and explains, “Main poore Chessland ko dekhta hoon. Aur ab… chalo, main tumhe Chessland ke protectors se milata hoon!”
A golden light shines as the King enters, stretching and yawning.
The King slowly says, “Ahem, ahem… kaun hai jo meri royal naptime disturb kar raha hai?”
Chessy teases him, telling him that young guests have come to meet him.
The King stands up and says warmly, “Oh hello, mere royal guests! Main hoon Chessland ka King—sab mujhe K bulate hain!”
Chintu whispers to Minku that the King looks like their father when he wakes up from a nap.
The King laughs and says, “Haha, sahi kaha! Main dheere chalta hoon, par sabko safe rakhta hoon. Chessland mein sab milkar mujhe protect karte hain!”
Minku asks if everyone fights to keep him safe.
Chessy gently explains, “Bilkul! Jaise tum apna chocolate protect karti ho Chintu se… woh chocolate tumhara King hota hai!”
Chintu happily says, “Ooooh, chocolate King!” and everyone laughs.
 The King happily says, “Chessy, ab inhe Chessland ke baaki residents se milvao!”
Chessy smiles and says, “Chalo dosto, aage badhte hain. Bye-bye King K!”
A beautiful glow appears and the Queen enters with a warm smile.
She says, “Hello mere pyare stars! Main hoon Chessland ki Queen, sab mujhe Q kehte hai.”
Minku says she looks just like her mother, who does everything at once.
The Queen laughs and says, “Haan beta, Queens aur mums kabhi rest nahi karte. Hum sabko safe rakhte hain — pyaar se.”
Chessy guides everyone forward.
The Rook marches in like a tall tower. He says, “Hey little explorers! Main hoon R — Chessland ka strong protector!”
Chintu says he looks as strong as his grandpa.
Rook proudly replies, “Haha, bilkul! Main hamesha King ko safe rakhta hoon!”
The Bishop slides in playfully.
He says, “Hiii buddies! Main hoon B — thoda fun, thoda silly!”
Minku giggles and says he’s just like her uncle.
The Bishop says he walks slanted and likes having fun.
A loud “Nayyyy!” echoes and the Knight jumps into the scene.
He says, “Make way! Main hoon N — jo hamesha jump karke aata hoon!”
Chintu teases that he is just like Minku when she jumps excitedly.
Everyone laughs.
Chessy tells the children that all the protectors want to say hello.
He asks them to tap whichever protector they like.
When the child taps the Queen, she says she takes care of everyone.
When they tap the Rook, he says he is straight and strong.
When they tap the Knight, he jumps and greets them.
Chessy celebrates and tells the child that they have made friends.
The group then reaches Pawn Village, where tiny footsteps can be heard.
The Pawn Leader appears and says, “Hello explorers! Hum chhote hain, par hum brave protectors hain!”
Minku calls them baby soldiers.
Chintu says they look like heroes who keep everyone safe.
The Pawn Leader proudly says, “Exactly! Hum King ko protect karte hain!”
Chessy asks the children to tap each Pawn when it pops up to say hello.
Each tap makes a cute “peep” sound, and after three taps, a small sparkle celebration appears.
Chessy tells the children that the Pawns are now their friends.
Chessy gathers everyone — the Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawns — and explains that they all work together to protect King K. Chessland is like a family.
Chintu laughs and says, “Toh main Knight hoon! Chocolate ke liye jump karunga!”
Everyone laughs together.
Chessy concludes happily, saying, “Shabash dosto! Agla adventure — ready? Chalo!”
