Sparkles begin to shimmer as a soft golden glow appears around King K. Chintu and Minku are standing on the magical squares of Chessland while Chessy floats toward them with a smile.
Chessy welcomes them back and says, “Welcome back dosto! Aaj tum miloge Chessland ke sabse IMPORTANT leader se — King K!”
The golden light becomes brighter as King K makes his entrance with a cute stretch. He smiles and says, “Namaste mere chhote explorers! Ready for a royal lesson?”
Minku looks curious and asks, “King ji, aap Queen ki tarah zoom-zoom chal sakte ho?”
The King laughs softly and replies, “Arre nahi beta! Main bohot sambhal kar chalta hoon… sirf ek kadam. Bas ek!”
Chessy explains gently, “Haan! King har direction mein ja sakta hai — aage, peeche, side, ya diagonal… par sirf ek ek kadam.”
The background slowly dims as if a story is beginning. Chessy says, “Dosto… socho agar King ko koi protect na kare…”
A dark glimpse of a sad kingdom appears for a moment.
Chessy adds, “Toh pura Chessland andhera ho jata hai. King hai toh kingdom hai.”
Minku softly says, “Toh King hi toh sabse important hai…”
The King smiles warmly and says, “Bilkul, beta. Isliye main sambhal kar chalta hoon.”
Chessy asks, “Toh dosto, aaj kya sikha?”
Minku excitedly says, “King one step chalta hai!”
Chintu proudly adds, “Aur sab usse protect karte hain!”
The King smiles proudly and says, “Perfect! Tum sab ab mere royal protectors ho!”
Everyone laughs together.
