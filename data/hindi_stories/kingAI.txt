Sparkles begin to shimmer as a soft golden glow appears around King K. Chintu and Minku are standing on the magical squares of Chessland while Chessy floats toward them with a smile.
Chessy welcomes them back and says, “Welcome back dosto! Aaj tum miloge Chessland ke sabse IMPORTANT leader se — King K!”
Chessy gently reminds that letter K hamesha King ko yaad dilata hai.
The golden light becomes brighter as King K makes his entrance with a cute stretch. He smiles and says, “Namaste mere chhote explorers! Ready for a royal lesson?”
Minku looks curious and asks, “King ji, aap Kese chalte ho?”
The King laughs softly and replies, “Arre beta! Main bohot sambhal kar chalta hoon… sirf ek kadam. Bas ek!”
Chessy explains clearly that King sirf ek square move karta hai.
Chessy explains gently, “Haan! King har direction mein ja sakta hai — aage, peeche, side, ya diagonal… par sirf ek ek kadam.”
Chessy adds that jab bhi koi poochta hai “King kaise chalta hai?”, answer hota hai:
King har direction mein, par sirf ek step chalta hai.
The background slowly dims as if a story is beginning. Chessy says, “Dosto… socho agar King ko koi protect na kare…”
A dark glimpse of a sad kingdom appears for a moment.
Chessy adds, “Toh pura Chessland andhera ho jata hai. King hai toh kingdom hai.”
Chessy explains that King sabse important piece hota hai, isliye game ka goal King ko protect karna hota hai.
Minku softly says, “Toh King hi toh sabse important hai…”
The King smiles warmly and says, “Bilkul, beta. Isliye main sambhal kar chalta hoon.”
Chessy gently explains that King dheere chalta hai kyunki sabse important piece ko hamesha safe rehna hota hai.
Chessy asks, “Toh dosto, aaj kya sikha?”
Minku excitedly says, “King one step chalta hai!”
Chintu proudly adds, “Aur sab usse protect karte hain!”
Chessy repeats clearly:
K = King
King sirf ek step chalta hai aur kisi bhi direction mein.
King sabse important hota hai
King k bina pura game khatam ho jaata hai. Pura kingdom dark ho jaata hai.
