Sparkles rise gently as Pawn Village appears. On both sides of the path, tiny Pawns stand in neat rows, holding little helmets that shine softly. Chessy happily welcomes the children and says, “Welcome back, explorers! Aaj hum aaye hain Pawn Village—Chessland ke sabse hardworking protectors ke ghar!”
Chintu looks amazed and says, “Ooooh! They look like tiny toy soldiers!”
Minku asks, “Aww, sab seedhi line mein kyun khade hain?”
Chessy explains, “Kyuki Pawns hamesha front line se apni adventure shuru karte hain aur wo always are ready to protect the King!”
Chessy adds that Pawns sabse aage khade hote hain kyunki woh pehle protect karte hain.

Minku wonders aloud, “Kya Aap sirf ek step chalte ho?”
The Pawn proudly answers, “Haan! Slow and steady—soldiers sirf aage badhte hain!”
Chessy explains clearly that Pawn normally ek step aage chalta hai, peeche nahi.
Chessy adds, “Par game ke start mein… Pawn do steps bhi le sakta hai!”

Chessy gently explains that Pawn sirf pehli move mein do steps chal sakta hai.
The Pawn pulls out a tiny sword, swings it diagonally, and says, “Aur fight karte waqt… hum slant mein attack karte hain!”

Chessy explains that Pawn seedha move karta hai, par diagonal yaani slant attack karta hai.
Minku giggles and says, “Straight chalna, slant fight karna—yeh toh funny ninja rule hai!”

Chessy concludes, “Dekha dosto? Pawns chhote hote hain, par bohot brave hote hai!”
Chessy repeats clearly:

Pawn hamesha aage chalte hai aur pehli move mein do steps le sakta hai.
Pawn diagonal attack karta hai.
