Sparkles rise gently as Pawn Village appears. On both sides of the path, tiny Pawns stand in neat rows, holding little helmets that shine softly. Chessy happily welcomes the children and says, “Welcome back, explorers! Aaj hum aaye hain Pawn Village—Chessland ke sabse hardworking protectors ke ghar!” Chintu looks amazed and says, “Ooooh! They look like tiny toy soldiers!”
Minku asks, “Aww, sab seedhi line mein kyun khade hain?”
Chessy explains, “Kyuki Pawns hamesha front line se apni adventure shuru karte hain—ready to protect the King!”
A tiny Pawn stands near them and introduces himself proudly by saying, “Main hoon Captain Pawn! Ready for our parade!”
The Pawn Leader cheers and says, “Perfect march!”
Minku wonders aloud, “Aap sirf ek step chalte ho?”
The Pawn Leader proudly answers, “Haan! Slow and steady—soldiers sirf aage badhte hain!”
Chessy adds, “Par game ke start mein… Pawn do steps bhi le sakta hai!”
Chintu laughs and calls it a “Rocket boost!”
The Pawn Leader pulls out a tiny sword, swings it diagonally, and says, “Aur fight karte waqt… hum slant mein attack karte hain!”
A small “shing!” sound is heard.
Minku giggles and says, “Straight chalna, slant fight karna—yeh toh funny ninja rule hai!”
Chessy presents two icons and says, “Chalo try karo! Yahan icons hain—straight chalna ya slant attack?”
The child taps the icons. The Pawn moves straight first, then performs a slanted attack.
The Pawn Leader proudly says, “Excellent!”
Chessy concludes, “Dekha dosto? Pawns chhote hote hain, par bohot brave!”
All the Pawns begin chanting together:
“Hum ek step lete hain, but we are brave and bright!”
Chessy ends the lesson cheerfully and says, “Shabash protectors!”
